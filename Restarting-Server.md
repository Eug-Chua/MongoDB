1. Make sure you are in the same folder in the terminal. If you aren't, type in:
```
cd folder-name
```

2. Stop the server:
```
node index.js
```
Then press Ctr-c (not cmd-c).

3. Re-start the server:
```
node index.js
```

4. To keep your server updating (instead of having to refresh it by restarting it) use this package:
```
npm install nodemon
```
